## Project Description
The project description is a set of instructions for creating two classes, MyArrayList and MyLinkedList, that implement the List interface. The purpose of this project is to practice implementing common data structures in Java.

For MyArrayList, you are instructed to create an instance variable of type Object[] to hold the elements of the list, as well as an int variable called size to keep track of the number of elements. You should then implement the add, get, and remove methods, as well as the size method, as specified in the instructions.

For MyLinkedList, you are instructed to create a private inner class called Node that contains an element of type E and references to the next and previous nodes in the list. You should also define instance variables called head and tail to reference the first and last nodes in the list, respectively. Similarly to MyArrayList, you should implement the add, get, and remove methods, as well as the size method, as specified in the instructions.
